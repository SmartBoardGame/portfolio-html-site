                    <h1>Game Jam Triumph: Navigating the Ocean of Creativity</h1>
                    
                    <p4> I am elated to share the triumphant story of my clinching 1st place in a fun game jam competition against 40 other talented Microsoft Discovery interns! ðŸ˜€ With the theme 'Ocean', I delved into uncharted waters under the guidance of my inspiring contributor: Joey Wunderlich (who helped me a lot with inspiration and technical problems). Frank Lee and Daniel Barkley were critical in giving me feedback as to how users might be confused by some aspects of my game and how I can better it. And 4th great contributor to my 1st place is Briana Roberts who was also a great source of inspiration and was great at teaching me a lot of soft skills that I used to communicate with the above 3 contributors.</p4>
                    <div></div>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p4> As a Microsoft Discovery intern, I never envisioned game development as a career path, but this experience changed everything. From brainstorming concepts to crafting intricate code architecture, I gained profound insights into the world of design, collaborating with a fantastic team to create a captivating oceanic adventure. The journey was a deep dive into creativity and technical prowess, revealing a newfound passion that I can't wait to explore further. Immensely grateful for the learning and growth this opportunity brought about! ðŸŒŠðŸŽ®</p4>
