                    <h1>Thank you for your time and intrest in me, here is brief summary about me.</h1>
                    <p4>Hello, my name is Ivan Petrenko. I was born in Ukraine and so I can fluently speak Russian, English and understand Ukrainian. My family had to move to the US due to the war that unraveled in our mother country. At the current moment, I am pursuing an AAS-DTA in Computer Science at Renton Technical College. I should get it by the spring of 2023. Then I will use this AAS-DTA degree to transfer to a university with quality BS and MS Computer Science programs. If by any chance you decide to hire me, I will tackle any task swiftly and efficiently. If you need proof of that: just check out this website and other projects I have completed ALL in my free time while working at my as a computer science tutor and computer technician 20 hours/week in my college, while also maintaining a 4.0 GPA in my college and high school.</p4>
