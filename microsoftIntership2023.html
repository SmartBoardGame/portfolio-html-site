                    <h1>2023 Microsoft Discovery: A Transformative Internship Experience</h1>
                    
                    <p4> During my month-long Discovery Internship at Microsoft, I had the privilege of engaging with a myriad of Microsoft experts, spanning from UX engineers to project managers and software engineers. These interactions broadened my insights across various tech realms, offering me a diverse perspective that significantly enhanced my understanding.</p4>
                    <div></div>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p4> One of the standout experiences was collaborating with a team of skilled individuals to develop a professional Figma prototype tailored for Xbox's GEO team. The project, aimed at addressing a specific prompt while focusing on user satisfaction, allowed us to iterate through solutions and create a visually compelling outcome. Presenting this solution to an audience of over 70 individuals, including Microsoft CVP leadership, was a pivotal moment that enriched my understanding of the importance of user-centric design and feedback in shaping impactful solutions.</p4>

                    <h1></h1>
                    <p4> Additionally, the internship provided an opportunity for me to lead a structured 1:1 meeting series with an expert mentor. Crafting agendas for these bi-weekly sessions enabled me to dive deeper into various aspects of the tech industry, accelerating my learning curve and highlighting the immense value of structured mentorship in professional growth. These experiences collectively enriched my skill set and provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of a tech-driven corporate environment.</p4>
